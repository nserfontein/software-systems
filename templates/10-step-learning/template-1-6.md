# Step 1: Get the Big Picture

#### What is the high level-topic that you want to learn about?
- TODO

#### Briefly provide a summary of what your topic is about (the big picture).
- TODO

#### Break your high level topic up into smaller subtopics or focus areas (a.k.a. modules).
Some topics will have many subtopics, but others will already be specialized areas of focus.
The idea here is just to try and get a picture of how big the thing you want to learn is, so that you can determine the proper scope in the next step.
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Do you feel like you know enough about your topic that you have a good idea of what you don’t know and what you need to learn?
- [ ] Do you feel like you have an idea of how "big" your topic is?
- [ ] If your topic is big, do you feel like you have an idea of what subtopics or areas you could focus on in order to learn the parts of the bigger topic that are most important to you?
- [ ] Do you know why you want to learn about this topic? Does it still interest you? (Sometimes, you may find that you don’t really want to learn about the topic once you’ve dug in enough to understand the basics of what it is about. Don’t worry if this happens; you’ve just saved yourself some time that you would have wasted learning about something you aren’t interested in.)


# Step 2: Determine the Scope

### Time Frame

#### In what time frame do you expect to learn the topic you want to learn?
- TODO

#### How many hours per week are you planning to devote to learning your topic?
- TODO

#### Multiply weeks _________ by hours _________ = _________ approximate hours to learn your topic.
This is pretty basic information, but use this information to help yourself determine a realistic scope.

### Scoped Topic

#### What subtopic do you want to learn about?
- TODO

#### What do you plan on doing with the knowledge you will get from learning about this topic?
- TODO

#### Use the time frame, the subtopic, and what you will do with the knowledge to determine what will be your appropriately scoped topic and write it here:
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Are you sure you aren't biting off more than you can chew? Make sure the newly-scoped topic is small enough that you feel confident you can learn it in the amount of time you want to accomplish your goal.
- [ ] Do you have a clear picture of what you are going to learn about, even if you don't know how you are going to learn it yet?
- [ ] Try running your idea by someone else to see what they think about the size of your topic. Someone who already knows about the topic will be able to give you a good idea of how appropriate your scope is.


# Step 3: Define Success

#### What specific actions does the knowledge you are trying to acquire allow you to do? 
List as many of them as you can think of here.
- TODO

#### Of the actions you listed above, which one or ones would be most valuable for you to be able to do?
- TODO

#### Using this information, come up with a clearly defined success criteria that you will use to determine when you have reached your goal.
Remember, good success criteria will be measureble and unambiguous.
- I will have learned to _TODO_.
- When _TODO_.

### Checklist:
- [ ] Is your success criteria measurable?
- [ ] Can you easily determine when it is met?
- [ ] Does it provide actual value to you?
- [ ] Will trying to accomplish this success criteria steer you in the right direction on your learning path?


# Step 4: Find Resources

#### Start with books, since books usually contain the most well-researched and organized information. 
Look for the best 5 or so books you can find on your topic and list them here. 
Utilize customer reviews to determine what material is of the highest quality. 
Don’t waste your time reading something that many other people think is not very valuable.
1. TODO
2. TODO
3. TODO
4. TODO
5. TODO

#### Now make a list of all the other resources you can think of. 
For blog posts and internet articles, you are probably better off just creating a folder in your bookmarks list for whatever browser you use and saving them as bookmarks there.
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Did you filter out your resources? DON’T! Not at this step. Only ignore the worst quality ones at this step.
- [ ] Did you get creative and think outside the box? Are there any unconventional resources you can think of that might be of help to you?
- [ ] Do you have enough resources? (For most topics, you should be able to find ample resources, but if you are trying to learn something like nuclear physics, you might actually have to visit a university library. Don’t move on, unless you have enough resources to complete your goal; otherwise, you’ll just be wasting your time.)


# Step 5: Create a Learning Plan

#### Pick what looks like your 5 best resources and list the chapters from the table of contents or the sections or headers used to break up the material here:

**Resource 1:**
- TODO

**Resource 2:**
- TODO

**Resource 3:**
- TODO

**Resource 4:**
- TODO

**Resource 5:**
- TODO

#### Take a look at what chapters or sections are repeated the most and write them down here:
- TODO

#### Add any additional modules or sections that you think need to be added to your learning plan, but might not exist as distinct chapters or sections in your resources.
- TODO

#### From both of these lists, come up with the modules for your learning plan. Put them in the order that makes the most sense to you.
(These will be used to repeat steps 7-10.)
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Are the modules in your learning plan roughly the same size?
- [ ] Do you have too many modules? (Too many modules may mean scope creep. Your scope may be expanding and you may need to cut it back down.)
- [ ] Too few? (If you have too few modules, it may mean that you need to break things down a bit smaller, or your overall scope may be too narrow.)
- [ ] Does the order of your modules make sense? Will the progression of your learning path ultimately lead you to fulfill your success criteria?


# Step 6: Filter Resources

#### What criteria do you think is the most important for judging the resources you will use for learning your topic? 
List the criteria you feel is most valuable to you here:
- TODO

#### Make your master list of resources here. 
Try to keep it to a reasonable size, so that you don’t feel overwhelmed. 
Remember that you don’t have to go through each resource from beginning to end; you’ll be picking what you need from each resource.
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Did you utilize the criteria you outlined in the worksheet for filtering your resources?
- [ ] Do you feel like the resources you have selected will adequately cover the modules in your learning plan? (If not, now is the time to go out and look for more resources before you move on.)
- [ ] Did you overdo it? Do you have far more resources than you can actually utilize in the time you have set aside to achieve your learning goal? (This is the most common problem, and it is very easy to think you need more resources than you really do. If this is the case, perhaps create a 1st picks list and a 2nd picks list, and see if you can get by utilizing only the 1st picks list.)
