# Step 7: Learn Enough To Get Started

#### What is the general idea of this module in your learning plan?
- TODO

#### What actions can you take to "play around" with what you are going to be learning for this module?
This can be tricky to decide. You may have to get creative. For something like a programming language or technology, the answer is usually straightforward. 
For something more abstract, your action might be something abstract as well, like a thought experiment or writing down a list of questions you have.
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Do you have at least one actionable thing you can do next from the basics you have learned in this step?

# Step 8: Play Around

#### What can you do to "play around" with the subject you are learning about?
List a few different choices if you can.
- TODO

#### Pick one of the things you can do and do it. Then list any questions you have as you are "playing around" here. 
If you aren’t coming up with many questions, you may not know enough to really get started. 
You may want to go back to the previous step and learn just a bit more so that you can do some meaningful experiments on your own.
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Did you have fun? It seems kind of silly, but this step should be fun. That is why it is called "play around" instead of "conduct your own experiments."
- [ ] Do you have at least 5 questions that developed from playing around? (The number isn’t so important, but it is important that you have at least some curiosity about the subject you are learning about. Otherwise it will be very hard to absorb the information.)
- [ ] Stop and consider what you were able to teach yourself just by playing around. Sometimes, you can learn quite a bit just by experimenting on your own.


# Step 9: Learn Enough To Do Something Useful

#### What are the most important questions you hope to find answers to during this step?
- TODO

#### Which questions are still unanswered after completing this step?
- TODO

#### What do you think would be an effective way to teach what you have learned in this step to someone else?
- TODO

#### What is the most important thing you have learned in this step?
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Do you feel like you have gotten answers to a majority of the questions you had in the last step? (If not, you may want to look for more resources. You may not have answers to all your questions, but if you can’t answer most of them, you may not be learning what you set out to learn.)
- [ ] Do you feel like you could regurgitate or teach what you have learned in this step?
- [ ] Consider how much the questions from the previous step helped guide you on this step. Use that information to help yourself ask better questions the next time around.


# Step 10: Teach

#### What methods of teaching do you find appeal to you the most? 
Do you like lectures, reading from books, watching videos, having a personal conversation, or something else?
- TODO

#### What do you think would be the best way to present the material you have learned in this module of your learning plan?
- TODO

#### Based on the answers from these two questions, determine how you will teach the subject matter you have been learning about and write it down here.
- TODO

#### After you have taught your subject, list anything you learned in the process that you had not realized or did not know before.
- TODO

### Checklist:
- [ ] Did you actually take the time to really teach the subject you learned about, or did you just do it in the hypothetical, saying "if I were to teach this, here is how I would do it?"
- [ ] Take a moment to reflect on the material you taught, and think about some ways that you could improve your delivery and organization of the information.
- [ ] If you had the opportunity to directly teach to someone else, solicit some feedback. Ask them how you did and how you could have improved. (Feedback is another way to learn quickly. Others can often see what we are doing wrong better than we can.)
- [ ] Consider publishing or giving away the learning materials you created from this step. What you created might be useful to someone else. (A blog is a great way to share what you are learning and help others.)
